# uploadfilter

`uploadfilter` is a free, open-source upload filter that aims to help your website comply with impending EU copyright law and with its possible national implementations in member states of the EU.


## Why uploadfilter?

As of June 2018, chances are that the EU parliament may soon pass a new copyright policy, which includes the controversial articles 11 and 13, and that this policy will be implemented as national law in EU member states.

According to the policy proposed, you will have to filter user contributions if you own or operate an online platform.


## What’s in it for me?

**This project is a chance for you** to shape the technical, organizational and social details and effects of content filters in case the EU proposal will become national law.

In case upload filters become mandatory, `uploadfilter` may evolve to **an actual upload filter that you can download and integrate into your website** to help you be compliant.


## How does uploadfilter work?

tl;dr **It doesn’t.** And hopefully, it never will.

It is [widely questioned by experts](https://juliareda.eu/eu-copyright-reform/censorship-machines/) that upload filters are an effective solution to enforce the rights of copyright holders without hurting freedom of expression.

This project only exists to prepare website admins for the worst case: only if the EU parliament were to pass the controversial policy, and member states of the EU to implement it as national law, then (and only then) content platform operators may feel a need to act.

It’s up to you as a website owner to decide whether a free, transparent, and open-source upload filter might be a better fit for your website than an uncontrollable proprietary, commercial, and closed-source solution.

As long as upload filters are not mandatory according to national law in EU member states, **this project may as well remain a stub forever.**


## Installing uploadfilter

**You can’t.** (See above.)


## Contributing

No matter if you’re a website administrator, a representative of rights owners, or generally a user and digital EU citizen who cares about freedom of expression and online culture, **feel free to contribute** to this project. It doesn’t matter whether you favor or oppose upload filters.
